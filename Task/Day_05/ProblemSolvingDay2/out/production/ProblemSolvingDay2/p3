3.	Construct a dictionary (HashTable/HashMap any one of your wishes), and print them.
Each individual can have none, one or more than one address.
Code for the given scenario, making the individual name as the unique key
            Akib has 3 addresses = Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Shiddheshwari ->
            Sajeeb has 1 address =  Lalmatia
            Niloy has 2 addresses = Puran Dhaka, Rajarbag ->
            Ratul lives abroad has no address


i) Construct the Dictionary, using the scenario above.
ii) Print them such that the output is like this

Individual 1: Akib Address 1: Mirpur Address 2: Dhanmondi Address 3: Shiddheshwari

*The one with no address should show - "NO ADDRESS", but you cannot put 'NO ADDRESS' in the dictionary.


Work flow:
1. HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>
2. put any key and a list in hashmap
3. add value in this key
