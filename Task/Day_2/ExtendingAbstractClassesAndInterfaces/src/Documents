Question 3: Extending Abstract Classes and Interfaces

1.  You are working on a simulation game where different types of vehicles interact in a virtual city.
    Create a simulation framework using abstract classes and interfaces.

2.  Design an abstract class Vehicle
        with properties like positionX and positionY,
        and methods like moveTo(double x, double y) and displayInfo().

3.  Implement an interface Navigable with methods like turnLeft(), turnRight(), and stop().

4.  Design a class Car that extends the Vehicle abstract class and implements the Navigable interface.

5.  Additionally, create an interface Flyable with methods like takeOff(), flyTo(double x, double y), and land().

6.  Design a class Airplane that extends the Vehicle abstract class and implements the Flyable interface.

7.  Provide an example of using these classes and interfaces within a simulated environment.
