Multiple Interfaces and Implementation

1. You are developing a shape manipulation library.
Design a system using abstract classes and interfaces to handle various shapes.

2.  Create an abstract class Shape with properties
    like area and perimeter,
    along with methods like calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().

3. Implement interfaces Drawable (with a draw() method) and Resizable (with a resize(double factor) method)
    to indicate additional behaviors.
4. Design two specific shape classes – Circle and Rectangle –

5. that inherit from Shape and implement the appropriate interfaces.
Provide an example demonstrating how you can create instances of these shapes and utilize their methods.
